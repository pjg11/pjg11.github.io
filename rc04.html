<h1>RC04: Shell Scripting Adventures</h1>
<p>One of the things that helped me rediscover the joy of programming was making tiny shell scripts/functions for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>As I started using the command line more often, these functions helped execute commands that I would otherwise have to type repeatedly. And that set off a chain reaction - the more functions I made, the more ideas I'd get.</p>

<p>The first one I made was <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/scripts/tree/main/tzc"><code>tzc</code></a>, to convert time from another timezone to my local time. It was inspired by two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The RC application process, where all the interview timings were displayed in EST, and I needed a way to convert timings quickly, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://lazybear.io/posts/cli-of-the-week-19/">CLI of the week #19</a>, a post that introduced me to the idea of tiny shell functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I like about making tiny functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blubsblog.bearblog.dev/i-am-the-only-user/">I am the only user</a>, so I make them in a way that makes sense to me (bonus points if it makes sense to others too).</li>
  <li>It takes less time to go from idea to execution.</li>
  <li>It's a great learning opportunity, as I end up learning something new about shell scripting concepts or the thing I'm making the script for.</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a couple of functions while at RC - particularly over the last two weeks - which I'll share in this post.</p>

<h2 id="note"><code>note</code></h2>

<p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/cdkini/quicknote"><code>quicknote</code></a> recently, and really liked the way it was structured. It made it easier to capture notes and search them, so I made its <code>zsh</code> equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/zsh
note() (
    dir=$HOME/notes
    cd $dir

    case $1 in
        "open")    shift ; micro $@ ;;
        "ls")      fd . $dir --type file | cut -d'/' -f5- ;;
        "grep")    rg $2 ;;
        "rm")      shift ; rm $@ ;;
        *)         _usage ; return ;;
    esac
)</code></pre>

<p>A neat trick I learnt while making this is writing the function block in regular braces <code>()</code> - which runs commands in a subshell as opposed to curly braces <code>{}</code> - to prevent changing the directory of my current shell session.</p>

<p>The full code with error handling and usage information can be found <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/scripts/blob/a3d5993b8cf75f7ad50b684154735c8ab187ab10/note">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blog"><code>blog</code></h2>

<p>This function is my take on a basic CLI content management system.</p>

<pre><code>$ blog -h
blog - commands to manage your Jekyll blog

Usage:
  blog command [args]

Options:
  -h|--help                  Show this message and exit

Commands:
  new filename               Create a new post
  update commitmsg           Build and deploy changes to existing content
  publish filename           Publish post now
  publish filename time      Schedule post for a later time
  preview                    View recent post/draft locally
  preview all                View entire website locally</code></pre>

<p>These commands have existed as a bunch of separate shell scripts and aliases. Some of them have featured on this blog - a <a href="/jekyll-blog-setup#publish-your-website#testing-the-script">publish script</a> and a post on <a href="/schedule-jekyll">scheduling</a>.</p>

<p>The upgraded function code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/scripts/blob/a3d5993b8cf75f7ad50b684154735c8ab187ab10/blog">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rlist"><code>rlist</code></h2>

<p>I use Safari's Reading List to save links, and I wanted a way to manage them from the command line, particularly to view all links and delete a link once I'm done reading.</p>

<pre><code>$ rlist -h
rlist - Manage Safari's Reading List from the command line

Usage:
  rlist [options] command

Options:
  -h|--help    Show this message and exit

Commands:
  init         Extracts links and saves to $HOME/notes/rlist.tsv
  search       Search all links and open chosen link in browser
  delete       Delete chosen link from list</code></pre>

<p>The Reading List is stored in <code>~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist</code>, and the function uses a utility called <a href="https://www.marcosantadev.com/manage-plist-files-plistbuddy/"><code>PlistBuddy</code></a> to interact with the file.</p>

<p>Here's a demo of the search command, that works like a fuzzy finder, along with the option to open the link in a browser.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/674173" target="_blank"><img alt="Thumbnail of an asciinema recording of the rlist's searching functionality" loading="lazy" src="https://asciinema.org/a/674173.svg"></a>

</figure>
<p>This is possibly the coolest script I've made yet, as it took a while to understand how <code>PlistBuddy</code> works, and using <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum"><code>gum</code></a> for the fancy formatting added to the coolness.</p>

<h2 id="mkfunc"><code>mkfunc</code></h2>

<p>Lastly, a meta function whose naming is inspired by <code>mkdir</code>. It creates a file with starter code for a shell function when called.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/zsh

mkfunc() {

    if [[ ( $# -eq 0 ) || ( "$*" =~ "-h" ) || ("$*" =~ "--help") ]] ; then
            echo "Usage: mkfunc name"
            return
    fi

    tee $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/functions/$1 &lt;&lt; 'EOF'
#!/bin/zsh

func() {

    _usage() {
        # Add help text here
    }

    if [[ ( $# -eq 0 ) || ( "$*" =~ "-h" ) || ( "$*" =~ "--help") ]] ; then
        _usage
        return
    fi

    # Remove this block if function contains no subcommands
    case $1 in
        # Add other cases here
        *) echo "invalid option - $1" ; _usage ;;
    esac
}
EOF
    chmod u+x $1
    $EDITOR $1
}</code></pre>

<p>This function contains simpler help text, as there are no additional commands. The heredoc delimiter <code>EOF</code> is wrapped with single quotes to prevent execution of the variables within the heredoc (<code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>,<code>$1</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for tuning in to another episode of "things I didn't plan to work on"! It's interesting how I get more post ideas from side quests rather than the main ones 😅</p>
