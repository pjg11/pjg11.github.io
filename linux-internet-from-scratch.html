<p>This post is written during a batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a">Recurse Center</a>, a retreat for programmers.</p>
</div>

<p>Recently, I was brainstorming networking project ideas, I got curious on what goes behind connecting to the internet, and if I could do it from scratch.</p>

<p>I'm delighted to report that the experiment was successful, and I thought of sharing it here! I've tested this on Ubuntu, but I think it should work on any Linux distribution. If not, <a href="mailto:piya@pjg1.site">let me know</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="identify-and-disable-existing-configuration">Identify and disable existing configuration</h2>

<p>Before I could set stuff up manually, I had to figure out my machine's existing configuration and disable it, so it wouldn't interfere with my handcrafted setup.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/explanation/networking/configuring-networks/">Ubuntu documentation</a> was a useful resource to find out the services in use. The network on my machine is configured using NetworkManager and DNS is managed using the systemd-resolved service.</p>

<p>I figured out what the above tools had setup using by trying out some of the code snippets in the docs, so I had a plan and a final result in mind.</p>

<p>Based on this, I made a note of the following from  the existing configuration, which can be found by running <code>ip addr show</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interface name - typically starts with one of <code>eth</code>, <code>en</code>, <code>wlan</code> or <code>wl</code>.</li>
  <li>IP address associated with the interface</li>
  <li>Subnet mask - the slash next to the IP address</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I had the information noted down, I disabled<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> NetworkManager and systemd-resolved (both running as <code>systemd</code> services) and set the network interface to down:</p>

<pre><code># systemctl stop NetworkManager
# systemctl disable NetworkManager
Removed "/etc/systemd/system/network-online.target.wants/NetworkManager-wait-online.service".
Removed "/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/NetworkManager.service".
Removed "/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service".
# systemctl stop systemd-resolved
# systemctl disable systemd-resolved
# ip link set dev wlp3s0 down</code></pre>

<p>With this, the machine is no longer connected to the internet.</p>

<h2 id="additional-setup-for-wireless-interfaces">Additional setup for wireless interfaces</h2>

<p>There are two types of interfaces you could be setting up.</p>

<p>One is for a connection made by connecting an Ethernet cable to your machine. If you were to try out this post on a Linux VM, you would be setting up an Ethernet connection and can skip this section. The other is a wireless interface, which can connect to WiFi networks.</p>

<p>An Ethernet interface appears up/enabled at all times - even before it has actual internet access - as its connected via cable. Wireless interfaces on the other hand remain down/disabled until you connect to a WiFi network.</p>

<p>This led to differences during setup, which required me to add separate instructions for both, making the post long and confusing.</p>

<p>It is possible to connect to a WiFi network before having internet access - this would be similar to situations when your phone or laptop displays a "No Internet Connection" message while being connected to a network.</p>

<p>The tool that helps connect to WiFi is <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/basicnet/wpa_supplicant.html"><code>wpa_supplicant</code></a>. This is what the previous setup used, so I went with it. There may be a process for it running in the background from the previous setup which is no longer required, so you can terminate it if it exists:</p>

<pre><code># ps -ef | grep -i [w]pa
root         883       1  0 01:59 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -u -s -O DIR=/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
# systemctl stop wpa_supplicant
# systemctl disable wpa_supplicant</code></pre>

<p>The tool takes a configuration file, <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code>, which contains information about the WiFi network you wish to connect to.</p>

<pre><code># cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
	ssid="&lt;name&gt;"
	psk="&lt;password&gt;"
}
EOF</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;password&gt;</code> with your WiFi's name and password in plaintext. Yes, you read that right - a PASSWORD stored in PLAINTEXT<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I'm pretty shocked by this, but it seems to be a norm for WiFi tools, not sure why<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I was following <a href="https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=571188">this tutorial</a> which added further details to the network block like the protocol type and the encryption used. However, adding just the username and password seemed to work in my case.</p>

<p>Then, I ran <code>wpa_supplicant</code> with the config file:</p>

<pre><code># wpa_supplicant -D nl80211 -i wlp3s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant</code></pre>

<p>This is run as a background process (<code>-B</code>) so I can continue using the terminal to type other commands. I can confirm if the connection took place successfully via <code>iw</code>:</p>

<pre><code># iw dev wlp3s0 info
Interface wlp3s0
	ifindex 2
	wdev 0x1
	addr &lt;MAC&gt;
	ssid &lt;name&gt;
	type managed
	wiphy 0
...</code></pre>

<p>If the name next to the <code>ssid</code> field matches with name set in the configuration, that means the connection was successful.</p>

<h2 id="setup-network-interface">Setup network interface</h2>

<p>Without internet access, my network interface looked like this:</p>

<pre><code># ip addr show dev wlp3s0
2: wlp3s0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether &lt;MAC&gt; brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>

<p>It needed an IP address to be able to talk to other machines that was missing. I assigned it one based on the information I noted down from the previous setup:</p>

<pre><code># ip addr add 192.168.100.128/24 dev wlp3s0</code></pre>

<p><code>192.168.100.128</code> is the IP address and <code>/24</code> is the subnet. The subnet, - a shorthand for <code>255.255.255.0</code> - means that this network assigns addresses in the range of <code>192.168.100.X</code>, where <code>X</code> can be anywhere between 1 and 254 (0 and 255 are reserved).</p>

<p>I checked the interface after setting it to up, after which I can see the address!</p>

<pre><code># ip link set dev wlp3s0 up
# ip addr show dev wlp3s0
2: wlp3s0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether &lt;MAC&gt; brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.100.128/24 scope global wlp3s0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever</code></pre>

<p>With this, I was online!</p>

<p>Well, sort of. If I tried to ping another machine in the same network, it worked!</p>

<pre><code># ping -c3 192.168.100.141
PING 192.168.100.141 (192.168.100.141) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.100.141: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.09 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.100.141: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=92.1 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.100.141: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=113 ms

--- 192.168.100.141 ping statistics ---

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 4.088/69.678/112.835/47.144 ms</code></pre>

<p>However, pinging a machine outside the network didn't.</p>

<pre><code># ping 1.1.1.1
ping: connect: Network is unreachable</code></pre>

<p>There had to be a way to route packets outside of the network.</p>

<h2 id="set-a-default-gateway">Set a default gateway</h2>

<p>Accessing machines outside of the network requires a default gateway - an address that forwards packets to other networks when the destination address isn't part of the network's address range. In a home network, this address would likely be assigned to your router.</p>

<p>This information is added to the routing table, and is typically the first assignable address in the address range, <code>192.168.100.1</code> in this case. The default gateway was set using <code>ip route</code>:</p>

<pre><code># ip route add default via 192.168.100.1 dev wlp3s0
# ip route show
default via 192.168.100.1 dev wlp3s0
192.168.100.0/24 wlp3s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.100.128</code></pre>

<p><code>ip route show</code> displays the routing table. The first rule is the one I just set, and the second one specifies routing for the entire address range, which was set after I assigned the address in the previous step.</p>

<p>Pinging to addresses outside of the network now worked!</p>

<pre><code># ping -c3 1.1.1.1
PING 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=59 time=23.4 ms
64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=59 time=8.74 ms
64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=59 time=7.11 ms

--- 1.1.1.1 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2004ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.113/13.093/23.426/7.336 ms</code></pre>

<p>But if I were to try pinging a domain name, that wouldn't work.</p>

<pre><code># ping example.com
ping: example.com: Temporary failure in name resolution</code></pre>

<p>So close, yet so far. The error message meant that it is unable to translate example.com to an IP address, which points towards a DNS issue.</p>

<h2 id="setup-dns">Setup DNS</h2>

<p>The process of translating domain names to IP addresses is done by a nameserver. These name servers are defined in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, which on my machine was a symbolic link:</p>

<pre><code># ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 39 Feb  7 04:49 /etc/resolv.conf -&gt; ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf</code></pre>

<p>This was part of the previous configuration, as DNS was setup using systemd-resolved on this machine. Since I've disabled that, I removed the symlink and added my nameservers of choice. I used <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/">Cloudflare's public DNS server</a> in this case:</p>

<pre><code># rm /etc/resolv.conf
# cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
EOF</code></pre>

<p>Pinging domain names finally worked!</p>

<pre><code># ping -c 1 example.com
PING example.com (96.7.128.198) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from a96-7-128-198.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com (96.7.128.198): icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=269 ms

--- example.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 269.178/269.178/269.178/0.000 ms</code></pre>

<p>This brings mission "connect to the Internet from scratch" to an end! I had a lot of fun working on this and learnt a lot, I hope you enjoyed reading this too! Before I end the post though, there's one little side quest I wanted to cover.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-dynamic-addresses-via-dhcp">Bonus: Dynamic addresses via DHCP</h2>

<p>The IP address I set above is a static IP, which doesn't change. Each time I connect to the network, I can assign it the same address.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I need to know the address range for each network before I connect to it, which is time-consuming.</li>
  <li>Setting an IP this way might cause confusion if another machine has been assigned the same address.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution for this is to let the network assign an address when you connect to it, which is how your default setup most likely works. This is done using DHCP or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.</p>

<p>I got it working using a tool called <code>dhclient</code>. It doesn't work if an IP address is already assigned to the interface, so I removed the static IP and default gateway I had set first:</p>

<pre><code># ip addr flush dev wlp3s0
# ip route flush dev wlp3s0
# dhclient -v wlp3s0

<p>From the output, it looks like the network's router (<code>192.168.100.1</code>) assigned this machine with the address <code>192.168.100.128</code>, which is what I was setting statically too.</p>

<p>What I also noticed was that running this also setup the default gateway and DNS automagically - and that too to the same address?!?!?</p>

<pre><code># ip route show | awk '/default via/{print $3}'
192.168.100.1
# cat /etc/resolv.conf
192.168.100.1</code></pre>

<p>After some searching, I <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/563zjp/how_does_linux_machine_connect_internet">found</a> that my router (aka the default gateway) is also capable of handling DNS requests. More specifically, it can forward DNS requests to servers it has configured that are likely specified by my ISP, and then send it back to my machine. Pretty cool!</p>

<p>What's not so cool though, is that this one command basically automated almost everything I set up lovingly by hand :/ The experiment was still worth it though, as I now know exactly what steps the tool is automating.</p>
